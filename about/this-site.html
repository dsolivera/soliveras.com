      I created this site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a>, a static site generator that makes it easy to create your personal website. You can develop or make changes to your site locally on your machine and see how those changes will look like when they are live. GitHub pages supports <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> so it is very easy to make changes and push them to GitHub. GitHub will build and render those changes so you can view them live in no time.
